This app helps you remember what is in your freezer, when you put it in and when it will expire. 3 months before expiry, items will colour light orange/yellow, a month before expiry the items will colour dark orange and after expiry they will colour red. This is to help you identify items that need to be consumed before they expire or to remove expired items.

## Frozen and expiration dates

When adding an item to your list, the frozen date will automatically be set to today and cannot be a date in the future. The default expiration date will be set 12 months from today, cannot be in the past and can be maximum 2 years into the future.
